This is a cutting-edge AI detection tool built with **Next.js**, **React**, and **COCO-SSD**. It enables real-time object and people detection through webcam input, leveraging the power of machine learning to classify and identify objects with high accuracy.

## Features

- **Real-Time Object Detection**: Detect and classify objects and people via webcam.
- **Built with Next.js and React**: Modern JavaScript technologies for smooth performance and user experience.
- **COCO-SSD Model**: Uses the COCO-SSD (Single Shot MultiBox Detector) for efficient and accurate object detection.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: A React-based framework for building server-side rendered applications.
- **React**: A popular JavaScript library for building interactive user interfaces.
- **COCO-SSD**: A pre-trained deep learning model for object detection.
